## 🧩 About the Project

### 🎯 Goal

To **learn, practice, and master app UI/UX design** by working on real product-style problems using **Figma**.

You will gain hands-on experience with:

- UI component creation
- Auto-layout & constraints
- Variants & components
- Design systems
- Interactive prototypes
- App-first UX thinking

> **Note:** Try to maintain a single Figma file for tasks of this repository.  
> The complete theme of the app (all pages you design) must remain consistent.
